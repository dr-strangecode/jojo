## JoJo

JoJo makes is easy to transform your scripts into an api.

## Get started

1. compile jojo (I'll eventually make a little repository, but it will probably be a while)
2. create a config file - this is where you tell jojo about your scripts and what url to serve them from
3. create an init file - jojo just logs to stderr and stdout - capture those in your logs however you like

## Thoughts

I wanted something stupid easy to install that could be 100% repeated with code from configuration management. 
With this, I can create machines that have a single responsibility.  I can also quit logging in from one 
machine into another.

## ToDo

Add parameters

## Warning

This tool is a really sharp knife.  You can do really stupid things with it.  Use at your own risk and under 
close supervision from someone comfortable with doing dumb things in a safe way.
